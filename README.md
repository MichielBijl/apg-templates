# APG templates

Various designs for [Authoring Practices Guide](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/) code examples.

## Inspiration

* [TR documents 2016 restyle](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/design/w3c-restyle/2016/sample)
* [Medium](https://medium.com/@brycej/be-liberators-2406a95c5cd9#.vmpalgirn)
* [michielbijl.nl](http://www.michielbijl.nl/2014/09/25/buttons-with-a-double-function/#main)
* [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/click-svg-to-focus/)
* [CSS Tricks (extended tutorial)](https://css-tricks.com/the-blur-up-technique-for-loading-background-images/)
* [WCAG Diff document](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2016/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20160105/complete-diff.html#C7)

## Thoughts

* Include prettyprint?
* Keep concise; should be a clear reference document
  * Drop keyboard support tables? This information is in the APG (Authoring Practices Guide) anyway.
  * Link to JavaScript rather than include the whole thing?
* Include short code snippets?
  * As in: write it as a tutorial rather than dump the code.
