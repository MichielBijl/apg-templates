# APG templates

Various designs for [Authoring Practices Guide](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/) code examples.

## Inspiration

* [TR documents 2016 restyle](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/design/w3c-restyle/2016/sample)
* [Medium](https://medium.com/@brycej/be-liberators-2406a95c5cd9#.vmpalgirn)
* [michielbijl.nl](http://www.michielbijl.nl/2014/09/25/buttons-with-a-double-function/#main)

## Thoughts

* Include prettyprint?
* Keep concise; should be a clear reference document
  * Drop keyboard support tables? This information is in the APG (Authoring Practices Guide) anyway.
  * Link to JavaScript rather than include the whole thing?
* Include short code snippets?
  * As in: write it as a tutorial rather than dump the code.
